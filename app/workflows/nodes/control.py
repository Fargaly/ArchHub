"""Control flow nodes — branching, iteration, merging.

Phase 1 is intentionally minimal. The data model supports more, but this
is enough for capturing chat conversations and running them as workflows.

  control.if      — branch on a boolean condition (true / false output ports)
  control.foreach — iterate a list, fan out to a sub-graph (single-step v0)
  control.merge   — coalesce two inputs, prefer first non-null

control.if is the FIRST in-place stem-cell rebuild (G3, the byte-identical
cook). Its logic is no longer a bespoke ``_if_executor`` code blob — it is a
typed sub-graph composed from existing pure cells (``impl.kind=graph``), so the
node's behaviour IS a composition of library primitives, not an opaque
hand-written function. See ``_IF_INNER_GRAPH`` below and
``tests/test_rebuild_in_place_parity.py`` (the parity gate that proved the
rebuild byte-identical to the retired bespoke over its full declared output
contract — true / false / taken — on every input, including the adversarial
ones: None, missing, a non-list, the falsy-string forms, unicode + float).

Why control.if was the clean pick (where the round-1 schedule_builder rebuild
was REFUTED): ``_if_executor`` was a PURE FUNCTION of its two declared input
ports — it read ONLY ``inputs['condition']`` and ``inputs['value']``, its
``config_schema`` was EMPTY (so there was structurally no ``config.get(...)``
fallback for an unwired value to lose), it did NO ``x or []`` falsy-list
normalization, and it had NO ``isinstance``-guard-to-``status:error`` branch
(it has exactly two return shapes, never an error status). So a stem-cell
composition reproduces it EXACTLY on every input — there is nothing for a
pure-cell graph to fail to reproduce.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# control.if — the in-place stem-cell rebuild (G3 byte-identical cook).
#
# The bespoke truthiness predicate was:
#     truthy = bool(cond) and cond not in ("false", "False", "0", 0, "")
# and the routing was: value -> true (truthy) / false (falsy), plus a `taken`
# label. The rebuild expresses BOTH purely as a sub-graph of existing cells:
#
#   vin    (data.passthrough)  — the `value` entry; fans `value` to gtrue+gfalse
#   pred   (code.expression)   — computes the SAME truthiness `t` from condition
#   gtrue  (code.expression)   — `v if t else None`   -> the `true`  output
#   gfalse (code.expression)   — `None if t else v`   -> the `false` output
#   gtaken (code.expression)   — `"true" if t else "false"` -> the `taken` label
#
# `value` enters through ONE passthrough and fans out via INNER wires (so the
# single facade input seeds a single inner port — the lesson from the round-1
# refutation, where a facade input could only ever seed one inner endpoint).
# `condition` enters `pred`, whose `t` fans to the three gate cells. The facade
# port ids mirror the bespoke signature EXACTLY (condition/value ->
# true/false/taken), so the in-place swap keeps the frozen G4 port contract.
#
# Determinism / total-tolerance: `condition` and `value` are always seeded, so
# every expression has its names defined; `bool(...)`, `... in (...)`, and the
# ternaries never raise on any input — the composition is a pure function with
# no error path, matching the bespoke (which also had none).
